# dbfxsql


### ‚ú® Overview

This project aims to synchronize data between [DBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBF) (dBase) files and a [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) database. In order to do so, will provides a bi-directional data transfer mechanism, allowing to migrate data from DBF to SQL and vice versa.

### üìù Roadmap

**Required:**
- [x] Create a CRUD to handle DBF and SQL
- [x] Transfer data between DBF and SQL
- [x] Make a CLI to manage DBF and SQL
- [x] Registry file changes in a pool
- [ ] Compare records to sync specific fields
- [x] Set up a cron job to sync data

**Desirable:**
- [x] Upload to Github
- [x] Handle dynamic fields between databases
- [x] Send the location into the queries
- [x] Handle dynamic parameters as input
- [x] Assign the proper type to the values
- [x] Allow add fields in DBF (incremental id)
- [x] Get database folder paths from .env
- [x] Change detection in folders/files
- [x] Make a video to explain the project
- [x] Use config file to delimiter databases/tables/fields
- [ ] Auto create a DB in the create command for SQL
- [ ] Replace dictionaries with classes during the sync
- [ ] Force a sync between SQL and DBF (read all tables)
- [ ] Move from Sqlite to MSQL server
- [ ] Implement BEFORE triggers for SQL's table changes
- [ ] Set folders path via commands
- [ ] Upload a file as config via commands
- [ ] Validate the existents fields in DBF
- [ ] Separate incremental logic from the add feature
- [ ] Add a LIMIT option to the queries
- [ ] Add a FIELDS option to filter the select queries
- [ ] Sync tables before the sync (initialization)
- [ ] Generate logs for exceptions and errors
- [ ] Standarize the input by file and tables
- [ ] Validate Key Error for an invalid field
- [ ] Validate the length and all other similar names for types in DBF and SQL
- [ ] Allow +2 relations tables in the config file
