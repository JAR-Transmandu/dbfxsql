# dbfxsql


### ‚ú® Overview

This project aims to synchronize data between [DBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBF) (dBase) files and a [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) database. In order to do so, will provides a bi-directional data transfer mechanism, allowing to migrate data from DBF to SQL and vice versa.
